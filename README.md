## Browserless-Bot What it does.
Uses post requests to try and purchase merchandise from Supreme, all contained in a simple GUI.<br/> 

## How it Works (Simplified)
  1.) It uses BeautifulSoup to parse all the information given, and searches for the item you want and the various other values you need to process the order.<br/>
  2.) It uses Python post requests to create the form data and sends it to Supreme.<br/>
  3.) This all happens within a couple seconds, so that you are ensured that you can get the product.<br/>
